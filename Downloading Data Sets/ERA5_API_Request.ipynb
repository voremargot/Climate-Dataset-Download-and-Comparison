    "For requesting ERA5 Data you need an account with the climate data store (CDS). You must follow the instructions [here](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5) before running the API request. Specify the variables, times periods, area, and grid cell size you want (for ERA5 the maximum resolution is 0.28125 degrees). \n",

    "__Specific variable notes:__ <br/>\n",
    "_Precipitation:_ If monthly precipitation totals are needed, you must download hourly precipitation data and sum the datasets yourself, as the monthly averages produces precipitation averages for a month. <br/>\n",
    "_Evaporation:_ Like precipitation, if you require monthly totals of evaporation, download the hourly dataset and sum it yourself. "
